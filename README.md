# Codenames üéØ

## üîé Overview
Codenames is an online multiplayer game inspired by the popular party game. This project is a collaborative effort: I developed the client side using Flutter, while [my friend](https://github.com/AlexShatokhin) handled the server-side development. The project is built using WebSockets (socket.io) for real-time communication.

## üöÄ Demonstration
‚ö†Ô∏è You can try the web version [here](https://artemhula.github.io/codenames_web_demo/). Please note that the server might take a little longer to load after periods of inactivity.
